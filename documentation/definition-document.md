## Project scope

The idea is to create simple chess ai in Java.

## Algoritms and data structures

* min-max searching
* alpha-beta pruning
* some algorith to calculate advantages/disadvantages of a move
* tree and list

## Problem

Minimax algoritm will be the core component of the ai. This algorithm will choose which move to make. Min-max algorithm searches the game tree for best move. 
Alpha-beta pruning will be use to make the process more efficient and maka it possible to give more choises.

## Time complexity

Alpha-beta pruning is used reduce time complexity of using min-max algorithm.
