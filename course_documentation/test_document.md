# Test Documents

I have created junit tests to test different functionality of the program. My test cover directly basic elements (chessboard and move) and undirectly (coordinate). Gamelogic is tested directly and undirectly. Additionally, evaluation functions and minimax and minimax alpha beta algorithms are tested.
