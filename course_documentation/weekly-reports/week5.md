## Weekly diary

21.4.2021
* working with game logic --> this is so annoying
* Now moving pieces does not cause check mates
* time estimate 5,5 hours

22.4.2021
* game logics works --> gives legal move
* time estimate 2,5 hours
* still some problems when playing game in xboard

24.4.2021
* Peer review
* I think that game logic is now in okay situation --> I realized that some basic game logic is missing still
* read few articles and watched vidos about chess ai, minimax search algorithms and alpha-beta algorithm
* rework legalmove --> it need to work also with black pieces --> by doing this minimax works
* working with minimax
time estimate: 4h

## What I have done this week?
* game logic
* understanding of minimax and alpha-beta pruning
* peer reivew

## How has the program progressed?
* move logic
* removing bad moves (moves that causes check mate)
* side, minimax-algo

## What did I learn this week / today?
* I learned that chess is complicated game
* Next time use already made game logic
* minimax function and how it actually works
* alpha-beta pruning and how it actually works

## What remained unclear or caused difficulties?
* GAME LOGIC, GAME LOGIC, GAME LOGIC
* I understand how to code minimax-algo, however I need to rework my game logic that it can move also black pieces

## What do I do next?
* change game logic to work in both side
* evaluation function
* minimax algorithm
* time estimate for next week 20-30 hours
* adding finally tests

Time estimate:
12 hours
