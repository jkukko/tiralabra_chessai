This week did not go as I planned. First, I did not was able to spend as much time I had planned. Second, I had major issues with the chess template. I spend like 4 hours with my new mac to get Xboard and gradle to run. I can't understand why I was not able to do that. So, I took my old linux laptop and started to work with it. Well, it only took like 30min and I was able to get the project underway.

After I was able to get the project to run, I have familiarize myself with template code and test some things. It's been a while that I have coded java.
