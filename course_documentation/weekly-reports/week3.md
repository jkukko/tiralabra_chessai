This week I was able of moving forward with the project by using my linux laptop. It was a bit suprise to me, how much time I need to actually spend on creating chess game and the logic. For some reason, I though that this chess template had all of these and I could concentrate on creating the ai bot. Anyways, most of this week I spend on creating the chess game.

## What I have done this week?
* Trying to understand how the testbot works. 
* I have creating basic elements for chess game: board, coordinate, move, logic
* I was able to give my moves to xboard bot --> just list of moves, without no inteligence. However, this is a step forward.

## How has the program progressed
* Basic conspets created for chess

## What did I learn this week / today?
* java syntax
* chess logic
* chess template
* how give commands to xboard

## What remained unclear or caused difficulties?
* the actual bot is still unclear
* missing totally tests

## What do I do next?
* finnish the actual chess game --> it will give random but allowed moves to xboard --> same as the testbot
* start to build more sopishicated logic

Time estimate: 11 hours
