## Weekly diary
* 4 hours pawn logic works --> it gives all possible moves
* 4-5 hours fixing bugs --> updating board, rook logics works
* 4 hours creating logic --> finally proper drive to add logic

## What I have done this week?
* Chess logic works 
* Now pieces move in xboard --> the inteligence is only random move
* Now xboard movements are properlyt accounted in my bots chessboard --> this does not anymore cause illegal movements

## How has the program progressed?
* Movement logic of pieces --> still missing some moves of king and need for protection of check
* Xboard movements are accounted in my own bot's chessboard

## What did I learn this week / today?
* Chess logic
* Java syntax
* Basic java loops and if-statements (its been a while that I have coded Java --> great again code Java)
* Now bot works

## What remained unclear or caused difficulties?
* How I can create protection for check
* The min-max algorithm
* missing all tests

## What do I do next?
* finnish movement
* check protection
* after these two, game should be played
* start to create min-max algoritm

Time estimate: 11-12 hours
